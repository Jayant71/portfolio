Highlights: Analyzed 6 YOLO object detection models for PPE detection on the CHV Dataset. Optimized YOLOv8n models, achieving an 80.95% reduction in model size and an 83.75% reduction in parameters, with minimal drop in precision and recall compared with YOLOv8n. Executed rigorous testing protocols to evaluate YOLOv8 effectiveness against real-world ppe datasets, identifying critical areas for improvement which led to more accurate PPE identification within operational environments.",
